# 1. Use an official, stable, and lightweight Python base image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# 2. Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Prevent Python from writing .pyc files and enable unbuffered logging
# This ensures you see your 'Jamf Error' or 'Intune Error' prints in real-time.
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# 4. Copy only the requirements first (to leverage Docker's layer caching)
COPY requirements.txt .

# 5. Install dependencies
# We use --no-cache-dir to keep the image as small as possible
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# 6. Copy the rest of your application code
COPY . .

# 7. Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 5000

# 8. Start the application using Waitress (Production Grade)
# This replaces 'flask run' with a robust, multi-threaded server.
